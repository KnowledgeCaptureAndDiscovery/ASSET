# Accelerating Scientific workflowS using EarthCube Technologies (ASSET): Sketching interface

Repository for the ASSET sketching web interface

The goal of this project is to create a sketching interface for scientists to quickly draft their thinking process in their day-to-day activities.

ASSET will allow you to: 

* Drag and drop types of activities
* Connect them together with arrows to indicate their order
* Assign which tools are used for different types of activities.
* Export your sketches/import previous sketches.

An overview of the tool can be seen below:
